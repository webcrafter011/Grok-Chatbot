# Prompt to Response Flask App

This is a simple web application built using Flask that takes user input (a prompt) and sends it to an API to receive a response. The application uses the `x.ai` API to generate responses based on user prompts, and displays the response with a typing effect.

## Features

- **User Input**: Users can enter a prompt through a textarea in the web interface.
- **Response from API**: The user input is sent to the `x.ai` API, and the app retrieves a response.
- **Stop Generating**: Users can stop the typing effect at any time using the "Stop Generating" button.

- Python 3.x
